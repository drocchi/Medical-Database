# Medical-Database
Team project for Software Engineering course

***Text files (docs-pats-apts.txt, users.txt) are located in:
-Medical Database\Medical Database\bin\Debug

***Images are located in:
-Medical Database\Medical Database
--Datazene - Logo (1).ico is the image used for the icon at the top left of every window. (Doesn't have text.)
--Datazene - Logo.png is the image used for the login/menu page. (Has text.)

***Things I planned on adding:
-Encryption for both text files. (SHA256 with some hash.)
-Input validation for text boxes. (All variables in database are stored as strings, planned on using the masked text boxes for validation since it's more simple. ALL of the text boxes in the program are masked text boxes already so they just need the implementation.)
-Information for the "INFO" button describing how some functions/buttons work. (Like how to search, edit, etc.) 
-Add a bunch of doctors/patients/appointments to the text file with real information. (Currently just "a,a,a,a,a,a...", maybe do 10 for each?)

***Other information:
-You can just press login with no username or password to enter the program for debugging purposes. Can remove that code later from the login.cs file when we're done. (You'll see the code, there's a comment saying "REMOVE THIS LATER".)
-Install ALL of the fonts in the Open_Sans zip folder.
-Let me know if anything is confusing, I'm pretty positive everything works as intended at the moment and there's no bugs.
